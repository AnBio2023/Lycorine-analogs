Project Description: 

Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are significant global health challenges due to their widespread prevalence and severe health impacts. Effective vaccines and specific therapeutics are currently lacking, making the targeting of the highly conserved NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain a promising strategy. Despite its potential, limited efforts have been made to develop inhibitors for this critical target.

This study employed an integrated in silico approach, utilizing combinatorial chemistry, docking, molecular dynamics simulations, MM/GBSA, and ADMET studies, to target the allosteric N-pocket of DENV3-RdRp and ZIKV-RdRp. By leveraging this comprehensive methodology, we designed lycorine analogs with natural S-enantiomers (LYCS) and R-enantiomers (LYCR) as potential inhibitors of non-structural protein 5 (NS5) in DENV3 and ZIKV.

Key findings include 12 lycorine analogs demonstrating robust binding free energy (<-9.00 kcal/mol), outperforming RdRp-Ribavirin (<-7.00 kcal/mol), along with favorable ADMET score predictions (<4.00). Notably, analogs LYCR728-210, LYCS728-210, LYCR728-212, and LYCS505-214 exhibited binding properties to both DENV3 and ZIKV targets.

This study underscores the potential of non-nucleoside lycorine-based analogs, which may offer distinct or even opposing metabolic, toxicological, and pharmacological profiles. These analogs show promise as candidates for inhibiting NS5-RdRp in ZIKV and DENV3, laying the groundwork for the development of effective antiviral agents.
